# Macrocontainers for Legacy Applications

LeApp is a "Minimum Viable Migration" utility that aims to
decouple virtualized applications from the operating system
kernel included in their VM image by migrating them into
macrocontainers that include all of the traditional components
of a stateful VM (operating system user space, application
runtime, management tools, configuration files, etc), but
use the kernel of the container host rather than providing
their own.
